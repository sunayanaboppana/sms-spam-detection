# SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements an SMS spam detection system using machine learning. It processes text messages, extracts features, and applies classification models to distinguish spam from legitimate messages.

## Features
- Preprocessing of SMS messages (removal of stopwords, stemming, etc.)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Machine learning models (e.g., Naïve Bayes, SVM, etc.)
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains labeled SMS messages (spam or ham). It has been preprocessed for training and evaluation.

## ⚙ Installation & Requirements
To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk
